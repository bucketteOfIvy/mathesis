This GitHub contains the replication materials for Ashlynn Wimer's MA Thesis investigating 
the relationship between HOLC maps, systemic racism, and modern traffic crash outcomes. 

## Repository Overview

With regards to repository organization, my top-level folders contain the following:

* `notebooks`: all notebooks used for analysis and figure generation.

* `scripts`: all scripts used to acquire, wrangle, and transform our datasets. Please note that these scripts are intended to be ran in a specific order, indicated by their prefixed numbers.

* `data`: contains some of the data used in this analysis. Additional datasets will be written to this folder when running the scripts in `scripts`.

* `figures`: figures used in the final paper. Note that some figures had to be arranged in Gimp; the `.xcf` files used to do so are also included.

Python (3.11.4) and R (Version 4.2.3) were used for this analysis.
